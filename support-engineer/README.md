### 1. Docker
Docker is a tool to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. It allows a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies thus allowing him/her to `Build once Run Anywhere`.

You have to write a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) with **Ubuntu 16.04** as a base image. The image should have following packages present:
- telnet
- curl
- ffmpeg

Finally, when running a container from the docker image, it should launch with `bash`.
