## Reply policy

Since it's not possible to provide _reasonable_ replies to everyone, we have the following timeout policy:

+ Before phone screening, if you don't hear from us within 15 days of your application, consider the application rejected.
+ 7 days of no communication from candidate's side, if asked for a response, will lead to the application being marked as stale.
+ We will reply within 7 days of a question asked unless specified otherwise.
